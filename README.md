# Using-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-Wine-Quality

The goal of this project was to find and optimize the best machine learning algorithim to predict human wine taste preferences based on measureable, easily attained chemical properties of wine. Several models were developed using python in Jupyter notebooks. Machine learning techniques such as these could be employed to help in the wine-making process and/or marketing process for target consumers.


The project website is hosted on Heroku. To view it please do the following:

1. Navigate to https://ml-port-wine.herokuapp.com/
1. Notice this brings you to the project ``homepage``
1. Scroll down to read about the data and models used
1. Scroll to the top of the page to view the navigation drop down bar.
1. Select the drop down bar labeled ``Models``
1. Notice a list of all models on the website. Select one to be taken to that models page
1. Navigate to the Random Forest page and scroll to the bottom to use the prediction tool
1. Enter values for the listed wine properties within the specified ranges
1. Press the submit button
1. Notice that a predicted wine quality score is returned using our Random Forest model 

To see the trainining and fitting process for the various models, please clone this repository to your desktop and then do the following:

1. Select the repo folder name ``Using-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-Wine-Quality``
1. Right click and select ``git bash here``
1. Type ``jupyter notebook`` and then hit `ENTER`
1. Notice a jupyter notebook opens with files for each model
1. Select ``DecisionTreeModelFixed.ipynb`` to view the decision tree model
1. Select ``KNN Model.ipynb`` to view the KNN model
1. Select ``Logistic Regression model.ipynb`` to view the logistic regression model
1. Select ``Neural Network.ipynb`` to view the neural network model
